# SCP_Name_Search

This is a project I am making for fun without any intentions of anyone ever using it. I am testing out classes and tkinter gui windows on a webcrawler used for getting information on scp's based on their number/id (i.e. scp-173: http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-173).

I try to add something new to this program every now and then as to keep learning new things.

Please don't expect super clean code, as I said it's primarily for testing and fun.
